              How to run the Snakes on a Tor Exit Scanner



I. Introduction

The Snakes on a Tor Exit Scanner scans the Tor network for misbehaving
and misconfigured exit nodes. It has several tests that it performs,
including HTML, javascript, arbitrary HTTP, SSL and DNS scans. The
mechanisms by which these scans operate will be covered in another
document. This document concerns itself only with running the scanner.



II. Prerequisites

Python 2.4+
Custom patched Tor 0.2.1
Super Secret SoaT Sauce
py-openssl/pyOpenSSL
Bonus: 500M of disk space
Bonus: Secondary external IP address

If you do not have 500M of disk space, you probably want to do:

# rm -rf ./libs/pypy-svn 

and make a special script to update TorFlow that runs:

# svn --ignore-externals up .
# svn up TorCtl

Doing this will cause your scanner to not scan dynamic Javascript
for modifications. It will still scan static javascript, but it will
just ignore all modifications to dynamic javascript that changes between
non-Tor fetches (which is surprisingly a lot).

This also means that ultimately you will not be able to run a voting
scanner once we get SoaT integrated into the directory authorities,
because your scanner will vote certain classes of malicious exits as
benign that the other scanners are trying to mark as BadExit. 

Having a second external IP address will allow your scanner to filter
out false positives for dynamic pages that arise due to pages encoding
your IP address in documents.



III. Setup

A. Compiling Tor

To run SoaT you will need to compile a custom Tor binary due to bug XXX.
The patch to fix this bug is present in ../tordiffs/XXX.

It is also strongly recommended that you have a custom Tor instance that
is devoted only to exit scanning, and is not performing any other
function (including serving as a relay or a directory authority).


B. Configuring SoaT

To configure SoaT (and even to get it to run), you will need to obtain
Super Secret SoaT Sauce from Mike Perry's Super Secret SoaT Sauce Stash.
It contains the necessary pheromones you will need to enable you to
properly hunt some motherfuckin snakes.

Once you have the Sauce, you should copy it to soat_config.py and have a
look at its contents. In particular, you'll want to change 'refetch_ip'
to be set to your secondary IP address. If you don't have a secondary
IP, set it to None.

If you're feeling ambitious, you can edit soat_config.py to change the
set of 'scan_filetypes' and increase 'max_content_size' to something
large enough to support these filetypes. However, you should balance
this with our more immediate need for the scanner to run quickly so that
the code is exercised and can stabilize quickly.

You'll also want to edit ./wordlist.txt and change its contents to be a
smattering of random and/or commonly censored words. If you speak other
languages (especially any that have unicode characters), using keywords
from them would be especially useful for testing and scanning. Note that
these queries WILL be issued in plaintext via non-Tor, and the resulting
urls fetched via non-Tor as well, so bear that and your server's legal
jurisdiction in mind when choosing keywords.

You can also separate out the wordlist.txt file into three files by
changing the soat_config.py settings 'filetype_wordlist_file',
'filetype_wordlist_file', and 'filetype_wordlist_file'. This will allow
you to use separate keywords for obtaining SSL, HTML, and Filetype
urls. This can be useful if you believe it likely for an adversary to
target only certain keywords/concepts/sites in a particular context.

You can edit the contents of the wordlist files while SoaT runs. It will
pick up the changes after it completes a full network scan with the old 
list.


IV. Running Tor, The Metatroller, and SoaT

Once you have everything compiled and configured, you should be ready to
run the pieces. You probably want to do this as a separate, unprivileged
user.

First, start up your custom Tor with the sample torrc provided in the
TorFlow svn root:

# ~/src/tor-trunk/src/or/tor -f ~/src/torflow-trunk/torrc >& tor.log &

Then, start up the Metatroller:

# ~/src/torflow-trunk/metatroller.py >& mt.log &

Finally, start up SoaT:

# ./soat.py --ssl --html --http --dnsrebind >& soat.log &



V. Monitoring and Results

A. Watching for Captcha Problems

You'll need to keep an eye on the beginning of the soat.log to make sure
it is actually retrieving urls from Google. Google's servers can
periodically decide that you are not worthy to query them, especially if
you restart soat several times in a row. If this happens, open up
soat_config.py and change the line:

default_search_mode = google_search_mode

to

default_search_mode = yahoo_search_mode

and remove the --ssl from the soat command line until Google decides it
hates you a little less (this usually takes less than a day). The SSL
scanner is hardcoded to use google_search_mode regardless of the
default_search_mode because Yahoo's "inurl:" modifier does not apply to
the scheme of the url, which we need in order to obtain fresh https
urls.

It is possible changing that default_search_mode to yahoo_search_mode
BEFORE Google starts to hate you while still using --ssl will allow you
to restart soat more times than with just Google alone, but then if both
Yahoo and Google begin to hate you, you can't scan at all.


B. Handling Crashes

At this stage in the game, your primary task will be to periodically
check the scanner for exceptions and hangs. For that you'll just want
to tail the soat.log file to make sure it is putting out recent loglines
and is continuing to run. If there are any issues, please mail me your
soat.log.

If/When SoaT crashes, you should be able to resume it exactly where it
left off with:

# ./soat.py --resume --ssl --html --http --dnsrebind >& soat.log &

Keeping the same options during a --resume is a Really Good Idea.

Soat actually saves a snapshot to a unique name each time you run it, so
you can go back in time and resume arbitrary runs by specifying their
number:

# ls ./data/soat/
# ./soat.py --resume 2 --ssl --html --http --dnsrebind >& soat.log &


C. Handling Results

As things stabilize, you'll want to begin grepping your soat.log for
ERROR lines. These indicate serious scanning errors and content
modifications. There will likely be false positives at first, and these
will require you tar up your ./data directory and soat.log and send it
to me to improve the filters for them:

# tar -jcf soat-data.tbz2 ./data/soat ./soat.log

If you're feeling adventurous, you can inspect the results yourself by
running snakeinspector.py. Running it with no arguments will dump all
failures to your screen in a semi-human readable format. You can add a
--verbose to get unified diffs of content modifications, and you can
filter on specific Test Result types with --resultfilter, and on
specific exit idhexes with --exit. Ex:

# ./snakeinspector.py --verbose --exit 80972D30FE33CB8AD60726C5272AFCEBB05CD6F7
   --resultfilter SSLTestResult 

or just:

# ./snakeinspector.py | less

At some point in the future, I hope to have a script prepared that will
mail false positives and actual results to me when you run it. Later
still, soat will automatically mail these results to an email list we
are all subscribed to as they happen.


D. Verifying Results

If you would like to verify a set of results, you can use the --rescan
option of soat, which crawls your data directory and creates a list of
nodes to scan that consist only of failures, and then scans those with
fresh URLs:

# ./soat.py --rescan --ssl --html --http --dnsrebind >& soat.log &

Rescans can also be resumed with --resume should they fail.

By default, soat also does a rescan at the end of every loop through the
node list, though this may change, because we can't apply the network-wide
false positive filter to URLs during rescan mode.


Alright that covers the basics. Let's get those motherfuckin snakes off
this motherfuckin Tor!
